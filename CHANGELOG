Nagnu 1.1
=================

The source of data has changed from 
https://<nagios-server>/nagios/cgi-bin/status.cgi?hosts=all to 
https://<nagios-server>/nagios/cgi-bin/statuswml.cgi?style=uprobs.
This lessens the lines of html nagnu has to parse significantly.
On the server I primarily test with it went from ~45000 lines to 77.

Fix: Hosts without services was not shown previously.
Fix: Services and hosts with notifications disabled are no longer shown.
Fix: Problems parsing the nagnu.conf file should be fixed.
Feature: Hosts can now also be excluded in the same way as services.
Feature: Hosts that are down will always be shown before any services,
starting from top left corner.
